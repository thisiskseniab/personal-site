I was born and raised in the **Siberian** part of Russia, and so, as a walking stereotype, I absolutely hate hot weather.

I studied and graduated with honors with a degree in Economics from USC. Afterwards, I attended a software development bootcamp and got my first job in tech as a Software Engineer!

Since then, I have had a long career in tech, and got a chance to work with some of the most wonderful people to solve incredibly complex and interesting problems using various technologies, tools, and methodologies.

Now, I care the most about working in a value-oriented organization, in a team that values and celebrates diversity, close collaboration, and empathy. I'm highly effective at cultivating high-performing, high-trust and collaborative teams that are known for consistently and sustainably delivering exceptional results.
